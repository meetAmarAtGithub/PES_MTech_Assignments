Good morning everyone. Today we will explore Visual Exploration and Analysis of Diabetes Dataset.

To start with, our dataset has a total of 768 rows. The data refers to females ages between 21 to 81 years.
There are total nine attributes in the dataset and it can be further classified as- 
 Six attributes describe the result of physical / verbal examination
  1) Number of times pregnant
  2) Diastolic blood pressure
  3) Triceps skin fold thickness
  4) Body mass index 
  5) Diabetes pedigree function - a function which scores probability of getting diabetes based on family history
  6) Age in years

B) Two attributes are result of chemical examination
  7) Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
  8) 2-Hour serum insulin


C) Resultant Target Variable
  9) Class variable - where 0 stands for non-diabetic, and 1 stands for diabetic

The Objective of this data analysis is to find the significant factors in the first 8 variables which influence the 9th variable that is diabetes or not, through data analysis and visualization techniques using Python.

Diabetic Dataset and Jupyter program is hosted in Github to enable concurrent and collabrative working within the team.

First, we are reading data from github repository.
Next, we are checking info of data frame.
We have 9 columns, 768 rows and data types of all columns are displayed below.
Next, we are checking for NaN in the data frame. WE can see here there is no NaN Data frame. 
Finally, we are checking for duplicate rows in the data frame and there is no duplicate rows as well.

Next, I will invite Dinesh to explain about Data Cleaning and exploration.
